const STATE_NOTES = {
  'California': "California's Hospital Fair Pricing Act (Health & Safety Code §127400 et seq.) requires nonprofit hospitals to let any uninsured patient or patient with high medical costs apply for charity care if family income is at or below 400% of the federal poverty level (raised from 350% effective Jan. 1, 2025). As of 2025, CA hospitals also can't use asset tests, application deadlines, or credit reporting against charity-care-eligible patients.",
  'New York': "New York's Indigent Care Pool supplements hospital charity care. Hospitals receiving state funds must maintain formal programs. NY also has strong protections against collections during an active charity care application.",
  'Illinois': 'The Illinois Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act requires hospitals to provide discounts to uninsured patients under 200% FPL and sliding scale discounts up to 600% FPL in some cases.',
  'Massachusetts': "Massachusetts has some of the strongest charity care laws in the nation. The Health Safety Net program supplements hospital charity care for patients under 400% FPL. Hospitals must also screen all patients proactively.",
  'Texas': 'Texas has no statewide charity care mandate beyond federal 501(r) requirements for nonprofits. However, county hospital districts often have broader programs. Ask specifically about "financial assistance" rather than just "charity care."',
  'Florida': 'Florida law requires nonprofit hospitals to maintain charity care programs. The state also has the Florida KidCare program, which may cover children in your household regardless of your own eligibility.',
  'Colorado': 'Colorado HB 22-1285 requires all hospitals to provide free care to patients under 250% FPL and substantial discounts up to 400% FPL, and limits cost-sharing for patients under 600% FPL.',
  'Washington': 'Washington State law (RCW 70.170) requires hospital charity care for patients under 100% FPL and partial discounts up to 200% FPL. Many hospitals voluntarily extend these thresholds further.',
  'Oregon': 'Oregon requires nonprofit hospitals to provide free care to patients under 200% FPL and discounts up to 400% FPL. Notably, Oregon prohibits hospitals from reporting charity care-eligible debt to credit agencies.',
  'Minnesota': "Minnesota's sliding fee charity care law is one of the most patient-friendly in the US, extending meaningful discounts to patients up to 275% FPL at most nonprofit hospitals.",
  'New Jersey': 'New Jersey requires all hospitals to offer a charity care program and to notify patients of their rights at admission. The state funds a Charity Care subsidy that reimburses hospitals for qualifying uncompensated care.',
  'Connecticut': 'Connecticut requires nonprofit hospitals to make free care available to patients under 235% FPL and to maintain a sliding fee scale up to 400% FPL.',
  'Maryland': "Maryland's unique all-payer rate-setting system means hospitals must provide free care to patients under 200% FPL. The state Health Services Cost Review Commission enforces these requirements.",
  'default': 'Federal IRS 501(r) regulations require all nonprofit hospitals to have a Financial Assistance Policy (FAP). Ask specifically for their "Financial Assistance Policy" or "Charity Care Application" — hospitals are required to provide this documentation upon request.'
